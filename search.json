From a forest point cloud, it detects canopy layers based on local point density profiles.\nIt is a replication of the algorithm presented in:\n\nHamraz et al. (2017)\nVertical stratification of forest canopy for segmentation of understory trees within small-footprint airborne LiDAR point clouds.\nISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 130, pp. 385–392.\n\nThis project was published as an M.Sc. Thesis by Kehlert (2024),, accessible via:\nUNIGIS Thesis Repository"
